        "As a self-taught software developer I enjoy building progressive web applications, whether it be creating a game just for fun or building tools to make my life a little bit easier. I am a fan of all things JavaScript and like working with modern frameworks and technologies such as TypeScript, React and Node.js.",
        "After +2 years of teaching myself to program and playing around with different technologies, I am looking to switch gears and transition it from a hobby to a profession. I am currently looking for career opportunities as a full-stack web developer.",
        "Over the years I have built and deployed several web applications such as real-time chat apps, browser based games, and personalized dashboards. For more details, check out my GitHub and Portfolio in the links below."
