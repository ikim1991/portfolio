        "As a self-taught software developer I enjoy building modern web applications, whether it be creating a game just for fun or building tools to increase my productivity. I am a fan of all things JavaScript with some of my favorites being TypeScript, Webpack, React, and Node.js, while always experimenting with new frameworks or technology to expand my toolkit.",
        "After +2 years of teaching myself to program and playing around with different technologies, I am looking to switch gears and transition it from a hobby to a profession. I am currently looking for career opportunities as a full-stack web developer.",
        "Over the years I have built and deployed several web applications such as real-time chat apps, browser based games, and personalized dashboards. For more details, check out my GitHub and Portfolio in the links below."
